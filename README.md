In a Panel, the user can define the footprint (session area) by clicking and dragging on the screen freely or by configuring Width and Length and move the session area parallel to or following an axis at a defined spacing (Interval).  
## Vertical Sessions Viewer
 - The user can configure the point size and symbology.
 - Make horizontal and vertical measurement
  
### Note:  
    1) If the Layer Style is not set to "Classification" the Viewer will only show 32 classes in the default Qgis color.  
    2) The button "Get" define a squarer area with 1mÂ² to show the counting points inside of that area.  


A sample with some data are attached inside the samples folder (used in QGIS 3.34).
